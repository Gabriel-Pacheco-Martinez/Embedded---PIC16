# Embedded---PIC16
Assembly program developed as part of a coursework in University as part of my Embedded module.

## Objective of the program
The objective of the program was for it to act as a programmable display using the 8 LEDs from
the PIC16F887. The display had three different display modes:
  - Variable PWM
  - Side to side strobing display
  - Linear feedback shift register

## Implements
In order for the program to work, the following tools were implemented.
  - Subroutines
  - Peripherals
